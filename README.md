# GPTDroid

We propose GPTDroid, asking LLM to chat with the mobile apps by passing the GUI page information to LLM to elicit testing scripts, and executing them to keep passing the app feedback to LLM, iterating the whole process. 

GPTDroid demo video

![Demo video](https://github.com/testinging6/GPTDroid/blob/main/GPTDroid-demo.gif) 

We provide demo video as shown in below video for helping the understanding. The video link is: https://youtu.be/xvPURrLIr_w


We give source code (./GPTDroid/)

You can get the code through our source-code.

#### Requirements
* Android emulator
* Ubuntu or Windows
* Appium Desktop Client: [link](https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases/tag/v1.22.3-4)
* Python 3.7
  * apkutils==0.10.2
  * Appium-Python-Client==1.3.0
  * Levenshtein==0.18.1
  * lxml==4.8.0
  * opencv-python==4.5.5.64
  * sentence-transformers==1.0.3
  * torch==1.6.0
  * torchvision==0.7.0

Use the gpt-3.5 as follows.

1.We recommend using our OpenAI command-line interface (CLI). To install this, run
`pip install --upgrade openai`

2.(The following instructions work for version 0.9.4 and up. Additionally, the OpenAI CLI requires python 3.)

Set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable by adding the following line into your shell initialization script (e.g. .bashrc, zshrc, etc.) or running it in the command line:

`export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"`
  
 `
import openai
openai.Completion.create(
    model=MODEL,
    prompt=YOUR_PROMPT)`

Since the API of gpt-3.5 contains personal information, we will give our API key after the double-blind review. You can also use your personal API key.



We give experiment dataset (./Effectiveness evaluation; ./Usefulness evaluation/)

## Effectiveness evaluation (./Effectiveness evaluation/)
The experimental dataset for effectiveness evaluation 

The first is the apks from effectiveness evaluation, which contains 66 + 20 (20 from Themis benchmark) apps, the 66 apps information as shown in table.

The 20 apps from Themis benchmarkï¼Œyou can find in the Themis benchmark.

Because the storage space of GitHub is limited to 2GB, and Google Play requires that individuals cannot upload apk without permission. You can download them on Google play through the information in the table.
